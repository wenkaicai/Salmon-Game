2. Hi TA, our A3 2(b) requires us to randomize initial pebbles directions and velocities. Due to that requirement, I also add a function in 
world_system.cpp, so when we press "f" it shoots pebbles from the salmon's mouth and follows a fixed straight line to make interaction in-between
pebbles, and interaction between pebbles with turtles more clearly.
For the creative part, I add a force for the water. When our program runs, press "a" it will include the force of water, and the water flowing leftwards 
which is a harder mode(it makes pebbles harder to push back turtles due to the attenuation of velocity by the force of water). I also add a rest state 
when pebbles come at rest on the ground. To increase the difficulty I made turtles chasing the salmon also avoid fish, and when we press "b", it will 
switch back to our basic mode. Thanks for watching my README!
